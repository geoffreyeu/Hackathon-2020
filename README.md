# Coronacademy
UARK 2020 Fall Hackathon Project. Tutor matching app thingo.

# Testing
0. Download and install `node.js` and `npm` (I don't remember the installation process)
1. Clone the repo through the GUI or with `git clone https://github.com/Willard21/Coronacademy.git`
2. Open your command line and navigate to the project directory with `cd path/to/directory` (Check your Documents or home folder if you're not sure where it is)
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`
5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080/ - You should see the `index.html` file being displayed.

# Editing
(Anything where I say git <something>, just look for buttons with the same name)
1. Make sure you're on the master branch and it's up to date with `git checkout master` then `git pull`
2. Create a new branch through your local Git GUI or with `git checkout -b YourBranchName` (the `-b` is only needed if it's a new branch)
3. If your working branch isn't brand new, merge master into it to sync everyone else's changes to your branch with `git merge master`
4. Now make your changes in the repo file. Use whatever editor you prefer (Visual Studio Code is my favorite for JS).
5. To share your changes with everyone else, do `git push`. You may have to push to upstream or something like that first. Just check for GUI prompts.
